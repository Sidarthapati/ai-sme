This includes the following:\nCode quality: prettiness, readability, etc\nDocumentation\nTest coverage and test quality\nHelp triage bugs related to your area of expertise\nSubsystem Maintainers\nSystem\nPackages\nMaintainers\nNotes\nProducer (java, scala)\nkafka.producer, kafka.javaapis\nJun, Neha, Jonathan, Joestein\nConsumer (java, scala)\nkafka.consumer, kafka.javaapis\nNeha, Joel, Jonathan\nNetwork Layer\nkafka.network\njay, Neha, Joel\nLog\nkafka.message, kafka.log\njay, Jun, Prashanth\nReplication\nkafka.controller,kafka.server\nNeha, Jun, Prashanth\nCommand Line Tools\nJoestein, Jonathan\nSystem Tests\n/system_tests\nJoestein\nAPI layer\nkafka.server.KafkaApis, kafka.api\nJun, Joel, Joestein\nThis includes the protocol definition for each of the APIs as well as the request logic in KafkaApis.",
