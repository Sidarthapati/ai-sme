  "content": "Draft Apache Kafka Project Bylaws\nThis document defines the bylaws under which the Apache Kafka project operates. It defines the roles and responsibilities of the project, who may vote, how voting works, how conflicts are resolved, etc.\nKafka is a project of the\nApache Software Foundation\n. The foundation holds the copyright on all Apache code including the code in the Kafka codebase. The\nfoundation FAQ\nexplains the operation and background of the foundation.\nKafka operates under a set of principles known collectively as the 'Apache Way'. If you are new to Apache development, please refer to the\nIncubator Project\nfor more information on how Apache projects operate.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nApache projects define a set of roles with associated rights and responsibilities. These roles govern what tasks an individual may perform within the project. The roles are defined in the following sections.\nCommitters\nThe project's Committers are responsible for the project's technical management. Committers have access to and responsibility for all of Kafka's source code repository.\nCommitter access is by invitation only and must be approved by lazy consensus of the active PMC members. A Committer is considered emeritus by their own declaration or by not contributing in any form to the project for over six months. Project contributions considered for this purpose are any code contribution, code review, JIRA or mailing list discussion, documentation contributions, or user support on the mailing list. An emeritus committer may request reinstatement of commit access from the PMC which, if granted, will be sufficient to restore him or her to active committer status.\nCommit access can be revoked by consensus by the active PMC (except the committer in question if they are also a PMC member).\nAll Apache committers are required to have a signed Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file with the Apache Software Foundation. There is a\nCommitter FAQ\nwhich provides more details on the requirements for Committers.\nA committer who makes a sustained contribution to the project may be invited to become a member of the PMC.\nProject Management Committee\nThe PMC is responsible to the board and the ASF for the management and oversight of Apache Kafka's codebase. The responsibilities of the PMC include\nDeciding what is distributed as products of the Apache Kafka project. In particular all releases must be approved by the PMC.\nMaintaining the project's shared resources, including the codebase repository, mailing lists, websites.\nSpeaking on behalf of the project.\nResolving license disputes regarding products of the project.\nNominating new PMC members and committers.\nMaintaining these bylaws and other guidelines of the project.\nMembership of the PMC is by invitation only and must be approved by a lazy consensus of PMC members. A PMC member is considered emeritus by their own declaration or by no contribution to the project for a six month period. Project contributions considered for this purpose are code contribution, code review, JIRA or mailing list discussion, documentation contributions, or user support on the mailing list. An emeritus member may request reinstatement to the PMC, which, if granted, will be sufficient to restore him or her to active PMC member.\nMembership of the PMC can be revoked by a consensus vote of all the active PMC members other than the member in question.\nThe chair of the PMC is appointed by the ASF board. The chair is an office holder of the Apache Software Foundation (Vice President, Apache Kafka) and has primary responsibility to the board for the management of the projects within the scope of the Kafka PMC. The chair reports to the board quarterly on developments within the Kafka project.\nWhen the current chair of the PMC resigns, the PMC votes to recommend a new chair using lazy consensus, but the decision must be ratified by the Apache board.\nDecision Making\nWithin the Kafka project, different types of decisions require different forms of approval. For example, the previous section describes several decisions which require 'lazy consensus' approval. This section defines how voting is performed, the types of approvals, and which types of decision require which type of approval.\nVoting\nDecisions regarding the project are made by votes on the primary project development mailing list (\ndev@kafka.apache.org\n). Where necessary, PMC voting may take place on the private Kafka PMC mailing list. Votes are clearly indicated by subject line starting with [VOTE]. Votes may contain multiple items for approval and these should be clearly separated. Voting is carried out by replying to the vote mail. Voting may take four flavors\nVote\nMeaning\n+1\n'Yes,' 'Agree,' or 'the action should be performed.'\n+0\nNeutral about the proposed action (or mildly negative but not enough so to want to block it).\n-1\nThis is a negative vote. On issues where consensus is required, this vote counts as a\nveto\n. All vetoes must contain an explanation of why the veto is appropriate. Vetoes with no explanation are void. It may also be appropriate for a -1 vote to include an alternative course of action.\nAll participants in the Kafka project are encouraged to show their agreement with or against a particular action by voting. For technical decisions, only the votes of active committers are binding. Non-binding votes are still useful for those with binding votes to understand the perception of an action in the wider Kafka community. For PMC decisions, only the votes of active PMC members are binding.\nVoting can also be applied to changes already made to the Kafka codebase. These typically take the form of a veto (-1) in reply to the commit message sent when the commit is made. Note that this should be a rare occurrence. All efforts should be made to discuss issues when they are still patches before the code is committed.\nOnly active (i.e. non-emeritus) committers and PMC members have binding votes.\nApprovals\nThese are the types of approvals that can be sought. Different actions require different types of approvals.\nApproval Type\nDefinition\nLazy Consensus\nLazy consensus requires 3 binding +1 votes and no binding vetoes.\nLazy Majority\nA lazy majority vote requires 3 binding +1 votes and more binding +1 votes than -1 votes.\nLazy Approval\nAn action with lazy approval is implicitly allowed unless a -1 vote is received, at which time, depending on the type of action, either lazy majority or lazy consensus approval must be obtained.\n2/3 Majority\nSome actions require a 2/3 majority of active committers or PMC members to pass. Such actions typically affect the foundation of the project (e.g. adopting a new codebase to replace an existing product). The higher threshold is designed to ensure such changes are strongly supported. To pass this vote requires at least 2/3 of binding vote holders to vote +1.\nVetos\nA valid, binding veto cannot be overruled. If a veto is cast, it must be accompanied by a valid reason explaining the reasons for the veto. The validity of a veto, if challenged, can be confirmed by anyone who has a binding vote. This does not necessarily signify agreement with the veto - merely that the veto is valid.\nIf you disagree with a valid veto, you must lobby the person casting the veto to withdraw their veto. If a veto is not withdrawn, the action that has been vetoed must be reversed in a timely manner.\nActions\nActions\nDescription\nApproval\nBinding Votes\nMinimum Length\nMailing List\nCode Change\nA change made to a codebase of the project and committed by a committer.
