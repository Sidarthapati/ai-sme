  "content": "This page describes a proposed Kafka Improvement Proposal (KIP) process for proposing a major change to Kafka.\nSubpages\nKafka Streams sub page\n(lists ongoing/incomplete KIPs)\nKafka Streams KIP Overview\n(lists released KIPs)\nDormant/inactive KIPs\nDiscarded KIPs\nKIP discussion recordings\nStarted\nIf this is your first time contributing:\nSign up for the Developer mailing list\ndev@kafka.apache.org\n. The instructions to sign up are here:\nhttp://kafka.apache.org/contact\nCreate a wiki ID using the ASF Self-serve Portal (\nhttps://selfserve.apache.org/confluence-account.html\n)\nCreate a Jira ID (It's a different system than the wiki) using the ASF Self-serve Portal (\nhttps://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html\n)\nAll necessary permissions (create/edit wiki pages and self-assign Jira tickets) should be granted right away. If any permissions are missing, please send an email to the dev mailing list (\ndev@kafka.apache.org\n)\ncontaining your wiki ID and/or Jira ID requesting the missing permissions.\nPurpose\nWe want to make Kafka a core architectural component for users. We also support a large number of integrations with other tools, systems, and clients. Keeping this kind of usage health requires a high level of compatibility between releases — core architectural elements can't break compatibility or shift functionality from release to release. As a result each new major feature or public api has to be done in a way that we can stick with it going forward.\nThis means when making this kind of change we need to think through what we are doing as best we can prior to release. And as we go forward we need to stick to our decisions as much as possible. All technical decisions have pros and cons so it is important we capture the thought process that lead to a decision or design to avoid flip-flopping needlessly.\nHopefully we can make these proportional in effort to their magnitude — small changes should just need a couple brief paragraphs, whereas large changes need detailed design discussions.\nThis process also isn't meant to discourage incompatible changes — proposing an incompatible change is totally legitimate. Sometimes we will have made a mistake and the best path forward is a clean break that cleans things up and gives us a good foundation going forward. Rather this is intended to avoid accidentally introducing half thought-out interfaces and protocols that cause needless heartburn when changed. Likewise the definition of \"compatible\" is itself squishy: small details like which errors are thrown when are clearly part of the contract but may need to change in some circumstances, likewise performance isn't part of the public contract but dramatic changes may break use cases. So we just need to use good judgement about how big the impact of an incompatibility will be and how big the payoff is.\nWhat is considered a \"major change\" that needs a KIP?\nAny of the following should be considered a major change:\nAny major new feature, subsystem, or piece of functionality\nAny change that impacts the public interfaces of the project\nWhat are the \"public interfaces\" of the project?\nAll of the following are public interfaces that people build around:\nBinary log format\nThe network protocol and api behavior\nAny class for which the build generates Javadoc.  This includes (but is not limited to; look for\njavadoc {}\nsections in\nbuild.gradle\nfor the complete list):\norg/apache/kafka/common/serialization\norg/apache/kafka/common\norg/apache/kafka/common/errors\norg/apache/kafka/clients/producer\norg/apache/kafka/clients/consumer (eventually, once stable)\nConfiguration, especially client configuration\nMonitoring\nCommand line tools and arguments\nNot all compatibility commitments are the same. We need to spend significantly more time on log format and protocol as these break code in lots of clients, cause downtime releases, etc. Public apis are next as they cause people to rebuild code and lead to compatibility issues in large multi-dependency projects (which end up requiring multiple incompatible versions). Configuration, monitoring, and command line tools can be faster and looser — changes here will break monitoring dashboards and require a bit of care during upgrades but aren't a huge burden.\nNeither the\nconsole tool output\nnor the\nlog content\nis considered a formal public interface (see discussion\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread/jwcn88o4f4c19x1onymxmkddk3dcsckf\n)\nFor the most part monitoring, command line tool changes, and configs are added with new features so these can be done with a single KIP.\nWhat should be included in a KIP?\nA KIP should contain the following sections:\nMotivation\n: describe the problem to be solved\nProposed Change\n: describe the new thing you want to do. This may be fairly extensive and have large subsections of its own. Or it may be a few sentences, depending on the scope of the change.\nNew or Changed Public Interfaces\n: impact to any of the \"compatibility commitments\" described above. We want to call these out in particular so everyone thinks about them.\nMigration Plan and\nCompatibility\n: if this feature requires additional support for a no-downtime upgrade describe how that will work\nRejected Alternatives\n: What are the other alternatives you considered and why are they worse? The goal of this section is to help people understand why this is the best solution now, and also to prevent churn in the future when old alternatives are reconsidered.\nWho should initiate the KIP?\nAnyone can initiate a KIP but you shouldn't do it unless you have an intention of getting the work done to implement it (otherwise it is silly).\nProcess\nHere is the process for making a KIP:\nClick\nCreate KIP\n. Take the next available KIP number and give your proposal a descriptive heading. e.g. \"KIP 42: Allow Infinite Retention With Bounded Disk Usage\".\nUpdate the next available KIP number below.\nFill in the sections as described above\nAlso add an entry to the table\nKIPs under discussion\n(for Streams API KIPs, please also add it to\nKafka Streams sub page\n).\nStart a [DISCUSS] thread on the Apache mailing list. Please ensure that the subject of the thread is of the format\n[DISCUSS] KIP-{your KIP number} {your KIP heading}\nand the body contains a link to your new KIP. The discussion should happen on the mailing list, not on the wiki, since the wiki comment system doesn't work well for larger discussions. In the process of the discussion you may update the proposal. You should let people know the changes you are making. When you feel you have a finalized proposal\nOnce the proposal is finalized call a [VOTE] to have the proposal adopted. These proposals are more serious than code changes and more serious even than release votes. The criteria for acceptance is\nlazy majority\n. The vote should remain open for at least 72 hours.\nPlease\nupdate the KIP wiki page, and the index below, to reflect the current stage of the KIP after a vote. This acts as the permanent record indicating the result of the KIP (e.g., Accepted or Rejected). Also report the result of the KIP vote to the voting thread on the mailing list so the conclusion is clear.\nKIP round-up\nNext KIP Number: 1279\nUse this number as the identifier for your KIP and increment this value.\nA\ndopted KIPs\nPlease insert new rows in\nsorted order\n(descending by KIP number).\nKIP (please keep this sorted by KIP number)\nRelease\nKIP-1278: Configurable Retry
