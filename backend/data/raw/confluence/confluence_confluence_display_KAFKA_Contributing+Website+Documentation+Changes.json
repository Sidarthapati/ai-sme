  "content": "The website documentation of Kafka resides in a few different places.\nKafka Code Repository\nKafka code repo\nhas a /docs directory with the latest revision of the docs (not multiple versions, just one that matches the latest state of code).\nWhen you submit a code patch that requires doc modification, you modify all\nrelevant files in same patch and they get reviewed and committed together (ideally).\nWhen you submit a doc patch alone, you modify all\nrelevant files in docs/ directory and submit a patch.\nBroker/producer/consumer configuration docs are auto-generated from code. So for any changes,\nyou need to modify the\nrelevant java files (\nKafkaConfig.java\n,\nProducerConfig.java\n,\nConsumerConfig.java\netc).\nFollow\nContributing Code Changes\nfor submitting above doc changes using Github pull requests.\nWhen we release, we copy the docs matching the release and commit to the\nwebsite git repo\n.\nWe also do this occasionally to fix bugs in earlier docs.\nFor older releases,\ncontribute changes to the relevant branch of the release code\nrepository and this will be pushed to the website git repo as needed.\nKafka Website Repository\nThe\nwebsite git repo\nhosts some of the Kafka website pages that are not included in the Kafka code repository.\nIn some cases, like hot fixes, non-technical web page changes, we accept Github pull requests against\nwebsite git repo\n. However the\nKafka code repo\nis the \"source of truth\" for any and all documentation, except for what is only included in the\nwebsite git repo\n. You should always check the docs in the\nKafka code repo\nand make any necessary changes or fixes there before you open a pull request against the\nwebsite git repo\n.\nThere are a number of ways to preview edits on the web docs\nRecommended:\nUse the\nstart-preview.sh\nscript in the website repo. This requires you have Docker or Podman installed. Running the script will create a container image containing httpd and the necessary server config. You then just need to point your browser at localhost:8080.\nAlternatively,\nsetup your local web server to point to your kafka-site repo\n(it is a one time thing and will save you lots of time moving forward if you are going to continuously contributing to web doc changes),\nYou can also extract the content inside the\n<script id=\"api-template\" type=\"text/x-handlebars-template\">\n...\n</script>\n<div class=\"p-api\"></div>\nJavaScript wrapper in order to display it with a browser (it will lose the formatting decorations though).\nWiki Pages\nSome documentation are simply wiki pages. In that case, we simply modify the wiki pages. (You may need permission to modify the wiki pages. Please send email to\ndev@kafka.apache.org\nor\nusers@kafka.apache.org\nasking for the permission.)",
