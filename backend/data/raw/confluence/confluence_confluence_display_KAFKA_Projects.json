  "content": "This is an un-ordered compendium of projects and project ideas.\nNon-java Clients\nWe want to improve the client libraries for the major languages (ruby, python, c++, etc). Some of these don't yet have a 0.8 compatible library available and for others the client is somewhat limited and could be improved.\nAudit Trail\nLinkedIn has an\n\"audit\" application\nthat checks the correctness of the data pipeline by comparing published and consumed messages. It would be nice to get this open sourced as well as make a number of improvements to it.\nPerformance\nThere are a number of projects that fall under the general bucket of performance improvements that aren't called out elsewhere:\nImproved I/O management\n- Move the flush out of the main thread and avoid linux file locking.\nMmap log\nfor writes to improve small write performance.\nGeneral data-driven profiling and perf improvements\nMemory hardening. Now due to async requests it is possible to OOM the server. It would be good to write some torture tests for the server and work on hardening its memory usage patterns.\nCleanup and Refactoring\nPurgatory rewrite - The current data structure that handles async requests is a bit hacky and could be improved\nKafka API split - Currently we maintain a single class (KafkaApis.scala) that has all request handling logic. As we add apis this is unsustainable, we should have one handler class per API just to help shrink and separate this giant lump of code.\nMove build to maven\nExactly once producer semantics\nNow that we have replication it would be possible to implement exactly-once producer semantics.\nLog Slurper\nFor people who want to publish Kafka feeds for existing applications that produce log files it might be nice to have something more sophisticated than the console-producer. This would be a process that ran in the background and tailed log directories and read and published formatted messages.\nCluster Admin UI\nIt would be nice to have a simple web app that showed the state of the cluster--which brokers are up, what topics and partitions they replicate and lead, how much data they have etc.",
